### Next up: 
1. Add contents to different categories, the ones that I already have but scattered around my hard drive...
2. - [x] Try the "table of contents" function. If it works, I can upload long notes.   
3. - [x] Try to simplify the post page. Author info seems ok (I'm the only author anyway), but "recent posts" part is too large.
Setting 'paginate' in config.yml, config.yml default and also in page YAML doesn't fix that... 
I think pagination is meant to separate one page to many pages, so maybe it isn't supposed to work.
4. Add the site to google search, so people can find the site more easily

### Other things:
"ERROR `/favicon.ico' not found.". Need to design an icon soon... But access to the site doesn't seem affected.
